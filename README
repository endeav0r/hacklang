// ABOUT
//////////

    HACKLANG is an interpreted scripting language I work on from time to time.
My main goal is not to create a scripting language for general use, but to learn
more about implementing interpreted languages and the difficulties usually
encountered therein. Often times the best way to learn is to do.

// GOALS
//////////

    - Remain easy to modify and change (stay "hackable"). Often times I add
      features/rules to the interpreter in 5 minutes.
      
    - Keep a simple, easy-to-use C API.
    
    - Keep the interpreter simple and implement as much functionality as
      possible through the C API.
      
    - Be able to accomplish many of the simple tasks I encounter on a day-to-day
      basis.
    
    - Simple, minimalist syntax

// NOT GOALS
//////////////

    - Backwards compatibility
    
    - Speed (to a reasonable degree)

// BUILD
//////////

    As on this writing, build.bat is a simple batch file to compile and link
hacklang with mingw for Windows.
